If I don't have my project already in the Recent List, I need to grab it from my
team’s source control. Here under “Open”, you’ll see we have a new “Checkout
from:” section. In this section, I can go ahead and click to clone my Repo from
Visual Studio Team Services.

I just search for the repo I need and hit clone. I am working on the bike
sharing360Productivity app that will be used in the rest of the demos. I hear
BikeSharing360 is becoming so popular that they are expanding to multiple new
cities including Seattle.



### Lightweight Solution Load

1.  Enable Lightweight Solution Load from Tools Options.

2. Open a large solution.

Now that I have my solution, let's open it. A coworker warned me this one has a
lot of projects to load so I enabled Lightweight Solution Load ahead of time.
With this enabled, look at how quick my 100 projects loaded.
